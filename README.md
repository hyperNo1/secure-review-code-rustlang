# secure-review-code-rustlang
This code creates a shared data structure shared_code that can be accessed by multiple threads using a Mutex to enforce synchronization. The code for each thread can then perform logic for reviewing the source code, and the main function waits for all the threads to finish before collecting and analyzing the results of the review.
